[[Starlit Skies]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

Long ago, I started Starlit Skies as project to continue the lineage of the tabletop system that truly introduced me to the hobby, after its author abandoned that draft version entirely in favor of a PbtA inspired approach. As I worked on it, the product became more to me. Maybe... it was just the way I thought about roleplay that was abandoned.

After all, "roleplaying" means many different things to different people. For some it's like playing a game, and for others, like writing a story together. So, I decided what I would do. Starlit Skies calls back to how we played pretend as little kids, and when imagination and fantasy ere natural to us.

It's a childish thing, of course, one that we were supposed to put behind us as we grew. Most did as they were told – they refined that pretend into adult arts like theater, or improvisation. Others, stopped caring for fantasy, accepting that the banal was all that mattered.

I want to make a game for those of us who didn't know better. In the IRC channels and Discord servers and fangirl forums of our past, we continued doing as we always did as kids – without caring what the adults or our "betters" thought. For us, roleplay and play pretend are the same thing. We became the characters we imagined – princesses, knights at first, and then the heroes of our favorite shows.

We did it because it was fun, and we enjoyed imagining ourselves in these characters. Not for the sake of story, not for the sake of any art or anything so virtuous, but because we liked to.

We did it together, because together with others, we could imagine wonders we never could alone. The situations we imagined grew ever more complex – but the shape never changed.

When we learned that agreeing to what happens to our characters, when we put so much of ourselves in them is hard. Instead of abandoning that connection, we learned how to make rules to decide fairly.

At first, simple ones, like making rules against "godmodding" – telling other people how their character feels or what would happen to them. Later on, some branches even added simple dice roll systems, for when people wanted to leave a conflict to chance – or decide what "really" happens when two players disagree. In time, some of them even grew to be something that looked like a normal tabletop system.

That was the roleplaying culture I grew up with, and the one that still influences how I view tabletop today. It's childish, clinging to so many things most think it is better to abandon. But, that's okay. I don't write for those people.

Because, Starlit Skies is the system I wish I had when I was a kid myself.

## Inspirations

Starlit Skies is continuation of the line of system design started by the 3rd draft of **[Magical Burst]**. The following game systems serve as major inspirations:

* **[Magical Burst]** (3rd draft) by **Yuruki Zero Games**: The original mechanical inspiration for Starlit Skies, before its later drafts moved to an approach more similar to traditional PBTA.
* **[Project Rebirth]** by **Fact**: The previous author of a continuation of Magical Burst 3rd draft, who laid a lot of the groundwork experimentation with the system design that made Starlit Skies possible.
* **[Fate Core]** by **Evil Hat Productions**: A lot of the terminology and general narrative game flow that Starlit Skies draws on is inspired by Fate Core, even if it disagrees on many major principles of how play "should" proceed.
* **[Blades in the Dark]** by **John Harper**: The tabletop system that introduced a lot of the more narrative mechanical concepts used in Starlit Skies (such as clocks).
* **[Fabula Ultima]** by **Emanuele Galletto**: An original game system with a lot more mechanical complexity than PBTA or games inspired by Blades in the Dark, showing how those concepts could be bound together with more traditional tabletop systems.
* **[Library of Ruina]** by **Project Moon**: A video game with a very unique battle system. It inspires the flow of combat in Starlit Skies, and provided an example of how the tangle of reactions and boosts found in Magical Burst could be managed.
