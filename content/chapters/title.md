## What is this?

**Starlit Skies** is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by the magical girl genre of anime. In it, 3-6 players work together to play out a story, of the struggles and challenges of young heroes doing their best to slowly heal the wounds of a shattered world.

## Inspirations

Starlit Skies is continuation of the line of system design started by the 3rd draft of **[Magical Burst]** by **Yuruki Zero Games**. The following game systems serve as major inspirations:

* **[Magical Burst]** (3rd draft) by **Yuruki Zero Games**: The original mechanical inspiration for Starlit Skies, before its later drafts moved to an approach more similar to traditional PBTA.
* **[Project Rebirth]** by **Fact**: The previous author of a continuation of Magical Burst 3rd draft, who laid a lot of the groundwork experimentation with the system design that made Starlit Skies possible.
* **[Fate Core]** by **Evil Hat Productions**: A lot of the terminology and general narrative game flow that Starlit Skies draws on is inspired by Fate Core, even if it disagrees on many major principles of how play "should" proceed.
* **[Blades in the Dark]** by **John Harper**: The tabletop system that introduced a lot of the more narrative mechanical concepts used in Starlit Skies (such as clocks).
* **[Fabula Ultima]** by **Emanuele Galletto**: A unique game system with a lot more mechanical complexity than PBTA or games inspired by Blades in the Dark, showing how those concepts could be bound together with more traditional tabletop systems.
* **[Library of Ruina]** by **Project Moon**: A video game with a very unique battle system. It inspires the flow of combat in Starlit Skies, and provided an example of how the tangle of reactions and boosts found in Magical Burst could be managed.
