# Introduction
[[Starlit Skies]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

Welcome to **Starlit Skies**, a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by the magical girl genre of anime.

In those shows, magical girls are ordinary girls who were given the gift of magic, and burdened with the responsibility to fight for all that is good in the world. Unlike superhero movies or sentai shows, though, the magical girl genre stays grounded in the more mundane sides of life.

Its protagonists live normal lives still, going to school, and experiencing all the challenges of friendship, growing up and self-discovery like anyone else. They are a part of the world, and that is why they protect it. Rather than detached ideals or duties, they fight for the world they live in and love. In doing so, they learn about the world and themselves, discover what ails their world and struggle to make it a better place in the end.

When you play Starlit Skies, you and at least two other players work together to experience such a story – and thus, remember the depths of imagination we knew as children.

## Tabletop Roleplaying

Starlit Skies is a "tabletop roleplaying game" – and at its heart, those are the mix of two things: roleplay and a tabletop game.

In roleplays, people play pretend together. Most of us first learned how to as kids, taking on the roles of princess or police officer. Some of us went on to play our favorite characters in chatrooms and forums hidden across the internet. Some of us, even, went into theater later, learning about improv and the formal practices of acting.

In tabletop games, we agree to playing games with well defined rules. Some (like chess) we play to find out who wins, and some (like charades) we play just to see what happens. Unlike in video games, though, since you follow the rules instead of a computer, the rules are flexible and easy to change. You can always make a variation if a rule isn't working.

Roleplaying without rules usually turns into arguments over how to continue the story, as most of us found out as kids. Thus, the tabletop game part adds rules that help you decide what happens next in a fair way. This is how tabletop games and roleplay combine to make something amazing.
