# Chapter 2: How to Play
[[Starlit Skies]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

This chapter explains the most essential rules of **Starlit Skies** and how to play it.

## Roleplaying

**Starlit Skies** is a game about playing make believe. Alongside 3-5 other people, you take turns telling a part of a shared story and experiencing it together. Of the 4-6 people total, one is called the Host and the others are called players.

The **Host** participates in the story from the perspective of the world and the people in it, and presents challenges to the players through that. The Host's role is to ensure the story has its ups and downs, as well as to provide a rich and immersive world for the players.

The **players** participate in the story from the perspective of a **player character**, describing what their character does and how she reacts. A player's role is to play the part of the protagonists of the story, interacting with the Host's world, and creating the best story they can together.

### Characters {.u}

The stories of **Starlit Skies** focus greatly on the characters involved alongside the worlds of each Star. Beyond the player characters, the Host has the responsibility to play the **non-player characters** that fill out the world.

The Host is considered the player of their NPCs for purpose of game rules, and counts as a player when it pertains to their characters. All characters played by the same person are treated as entirely separate entities for the purpose of game rules.

#### How to write characters

There is not the space in this rulebook to explain how to play a character well; if you need it, such advice can be found in abundance in the writing, acting, roleplay and many more communities.

As it pertains to this game, the following key guidelines should be followed:

* Each character is portrayed by a single participant, whether the Host or a player.
* That participant is the only one who can decide what the character chooses to do, except in the rare cases where a character has the power to make others act against their will.
* Characters are fictional beings that exist in the story of the game. Their decisions should follow what such a person would do or what makes for the best story, not what their player would like to happen.
* Characters can only know things about the story that they've seen or learned. Players often end up knowing things that their characters don't, and care should be taken to portray well when your character doesn't know something you do.

#### Sidebar: Summons, Familiars, and other Shenanigans

Some character concepts (such as a summoner and their summoned creature) have more than one closely related entities that come together to form a single character.

In this system, the preferred way to handle these characters is for them to share a character sheet, and be considered a single character for the purpose of game rules (though not the story).

Usually, the same participant should control all the characters involved. If they would rather not, or do not feel comfortable doing so, another player or the Host can describe the actions of these "side characters" instead. 
:::::

### Scenes {.u}

Play in **Starlit Skies** is divided into **Scenes**, like a play. A scene is like a place and a length of time at once.

A character (player or otherwise) is either "in a scene" or not. Characters outside the scene generally can't participate in them, since they are assumed to be somewhere else. A scene lasts as long as it needs to for a section of the story to play out, or for the characters to go elsewhere.

There are no hard rules for when a scene begins or ends, and it's reasonable to go by feel.

#### Running Scenes

In a scene, a participant (usually the Host) sets the scene, describing where the scene takes place, who is there, and what it looks like.

Then, the players of each character involved describes what they say and do in turn, until the scene's natural conclusion. Other characters may join and leave the scene assuming the Host agrees and it makes sense in the story.

#### Types of Scenes

There are a few types of scenes that interact differently with the rules. They are:

* In a **Open Scenes**, there is no immediate tension. These are often social scenes involving characters talking, investigation scenes where there is no immediate danger, or slice of life scenes showing off characters' daily lives.
* In a **Challenge Scene**, there is a sense of urgency and immediacy. Unlike in Open Scenes, players take turns in a fixed order and use the games rules to determine how much their character can do in the timeframe of that turn.
* In a **Conflict Scenes**, characters are directly fighting with each other or opposing each other's goals. In these scenes, additional rules are used to represent the chaos of combat and flow of combat.

A scene can transition from one type of scene to another without ending. For example, if a fight unexpectedly breaks out during an Open Scene, it immediately becomes a Conflict Scene and uses the rules for one.

### Time in Roleplays {.u}

Longer durations of time are broken down into **Sessions**, **Chapters**, and **Campaigns**.

#### Sessions

Multiple scenes come together to make a **session**.

A session for the most part is like a single episode of an anime. In general, it starts when the players and Host come together to play **Starlit Skies** and ends when they decide to stop playing for the day. Generally, it may take about 4 hours to play a decent length session.

At the end of each session, the game rules for changing bonds and gaining experience are applied.

#### Chapters

A **chapter** is a short arc or section of the game's narrative.

There is no hard and fast rule for what counts as a chapter, other than that they should usually be about 3 to 4 sessions. The Host decides when a chapter starts or ends.

Some game rules care about when a chapter starts or ends.

#### Campaign

A **campaign** is a single complete story told using the **Starlit Skies** system. A group could play in multiple campaigns at the same time, but they are still separate stories that do not affect each other.

There is no game rules meaning to a campaign, but it's a useful distinction to make.

::::: {.sidebar}
#### Sidebar: Side Stories

Online play often enables players to run **side stories** alongside the main sessions, where player characters interact between sessions without direct conflict. These scenes do not always involve the Host directly.

Treat these as self-contained scenes and sessions, applying the rules for changing bonds but not for gaining experience. With Host permission, players may set the scenes for side stories instead.
:::::

::::: {.sidebar}
#### Sidebar: Styles of Play

This section is written with the assumption that the campaign is run in real time, where the players and Host come together routinely at a scheduled time to play (whether using voice or text).

For text-based sessions where players tend to write paragraphs in a post instead of a sentence or two, expect an average session to take 6-8 hours instead of 4.

For groups that do not come together at a scheduled time (for example, Play by Post via a forum or Discord) and instead play continuously during free time, handle Sessions similarly to Chapters, where the Host decides when they start or end.

## Character Statistics

All characters in **Starlit Skies** have several **statistics** that connects who they are in roleplay to the tabletop game part of the system. A character's statistics are kept track of on a **character sheet** that gives you all the information you need to use the character with the game's rules.

### Approaches {.u}

Characters all have three **approaches** that represent how good they are at approaching problems in a certain way, and how proficient they are at the magic that originates from those mindsets. The approaches are:

* **Dream** shows how well someone approaches problems through creativity or intuition. It fuels the magic of **Fantasia**, drawing on dreams and imagination and manifesting them into reality.
* **Heart** shows how well someone approaches problems through willpower or presence. It fuels the magic of **Fury**, drawing on boiling emotion and manifesting it as raw magical force.
* **Focus** shows how well someone approaches problems through wit or knowledge. It fuels the magic of **Arcana**, drawing on knowledge of the world's workings to control the flows of magic.

Approaches (alongside skills) are added to challenges when you need to roll dice.

### Traits {.u}

The three **traits** reflect who a character is, each corresponding to a specific approach. The traits are:

* **Image** is a character's view of who they are, or who they would want to be — such as Excitable Dancer, Flirty Princess, or Proper Lady. Image corresponds to the **Dream** approach.
* **Theme** is a character's emotional heart, and the emotions that best define their arc — such as Grief, Discovery, or Hope. Theme corresponds to the **Heart** approach.
* **Tale** is a character's history, and the things they learned growing up — such as Music Student, Art Lover, or Lawyer. Tale corresponds to the **Focus** approach.

Traits can be used to help overcome difficult challenges or to fuel Dissonance.

### Skills {.u}

In addition to the approaches, eight **skills** help define what characters are good at in mundane life. The skills are:

* **Athletics** shows how well someone uses physical prowess and strength, such as when climbing cliffs or bashing a door open.
* **Acrobatics** shows how well someone can move quickly and accurately, such as when navigating a tight corridor or dancing.
* **Finesse** shows how well someone uses their hands, such as when picking a lock of assembling a complicated device.
* **Awareness** shows how well someone remains aware of the subtle details of her surroundings, even in the moment.
* **Analysis** shows how well someone can determine the implications of known facts and connect them together.
* **Presence** shows how well someone can assert themselves socially, such as when pleading with someone or comforting them.
* **Deception** shows how well someone deceives others, such as when sneaking through a building or hiding how she feels.
* **Willpower** shows how well someone presses forward in difficult circumstances or resists outside influences.

Skills (alongside approaches) are added to challenges when you need to roll dice, and are especially important when dealing with hard tasks.

### Domains {.u}

The worlds of the Sea of Stars all have their own rules of magic, shaping raw Light into countless different forms. **Domains** are the special powers characters can draw from the Sea of Stars.

Authorities work like normal skills, but they aren't chosen from a fixed list. Starlit have their own **Starlit Authorities** that they can use anywhere, while Stars have **World Domains** that anyone in the world can learn to use.

#### Earth's Domains

**Earth** has several World Domains that are somewhere between skills and domains. They require resources and infrastructure that aren't always available, but are common from Old Earth being the origin of the stories in the Sea of Stars. These are:  

* **Engineering** shows your character's knowledge of mundane physics and how to build machines and infrastructure using it.
* **Computers** shows your how good your character is at working with computers, whether using them or creating new programs.
* **Medicine** shows how well your character understands anatomy and how to heal people using mundane means.
* **Nature** shows how well your character understands nature, and how to cultivate or care for plants, animals and ecosystems.
* **Operate (Earth)** shows how well your character can operate specialized machinery common to Earth, especially cars.

### Bonds {.u}

**Bonds** represent the connections characters have made to other people and the Stars. There are three kinds of bonds:

* **Personal Bonds**, representing your character's relationships with other characters.
* **World Bonds**, representing your character's understanding and integration into a Star.
* **Occulted Bonds**, representing the connections your character lost in the Shattering.

Bonds have **traits** just as characters do, helping detail how exactly a character views the relationship.

### Resolve and Health {.u}

Resolve and Health are two seperate measures of how much harm a character can take before being defeated. Damage to **Resolve** measures magical barriers and advanced armor, while damage to **Health** measures physical harm.

A character is **defeated** when their Resolve runs out, and **dies** when their Health runs out.

### Light {.u}

**Light** is a measure of how much energy a character has available to fuel their magic.

### Paths and Abilities {.u}

Paths and Abilities represent a character's specialized training in using a particular form of magic or technology.

As they grow more experienced, characters gain **Experience** that can be spent to buy **Abilities**. Most of these abilities are part of a **Path**. When a character first gains a Path, they gain an additional way to gain Light in conflicts, and a powerful **Keystone Ability**.

However, characters can only have abilities from up to two different paths. Particularly strong characters may gain more, up to a maximum of three.

## Foundational Rules

The game rules of **Starlit Skies** have a few basic rules used to make them less ambiguous:

* **Specific Beats General:** More specific rules (such as those of abilities) override rules they directly contradict.
* **Can't Beats Can:** A rule that says you can do something loses to a rule that says you can't, unless it's more specific.

The following rules are assumed by default, and can only be changed by more specific rules:

* **Always Round Down:** When you are asked to divide values, always round down to a minimum of 0.
* **All Dice Rolls are Public:** All dice rolls by the Host and players must be visible to everyone at the table.

If a single event causes multiple things to happen, apply these rules in order:

* **Effect Controller:** Each character's player decides what order their abilities trigger in.  
* **Active Player First:** Effects belonging to character whose turn it trigger first.
* **Initiative Order:** Afterward, each other character's effects trigger in initiative order (fastest to slowest).
* **Arbitrary Order:** If there is no initiative or active player, the Host chooses an arbitrary order between characters.

Finally, the following terms have a specific meaning for the game rules:

* **Ally:** Someone a character considers to be their ally, not including themselves.
* **Enemy:** Someone a character considers opposed to them, not including themselves.

While most rules of the game can be changed to suit a group's preferences, these rules should not be changed.

## Challenges

A **Challenge** is a dice roll used to decide what happens when two characters are in conflict, or when a character tries to do something inherently difficulty. They are always made by a specific character and are based on a specific approach and skill.

In the game rules, challenges are written like this: [Heart + Empathy + ▲▲△△]{.c}

The filled triangles ([▲]{.symc}) mean the result of rolling a four-sided dice. The empty triangles ([△]{.symc}) mean an open slot for a boost dice. The approach, skill and result of any dice rolled are added together to get the challenge's **result**.

### Standard Challenges {.u}

Unless otherwise specified by an ability, mundane challenges are rolled using [Approach + Skill + ▲▲]{.c}.

Similarly, magical challenges are rolled using [Approach + Skill + ▲▲△△]{.c} unless otherwise specified.

### Complexity {.u}

Challenges can have a **complexity** representing actions that inherently require a better understanding of a skill.

Subtract the complexity from the challenge's result. For each point the complexity is greater than the skill you used, subtract another 1 from the result.

### Beginning a Challenge {.u}

There are several ways that a challenge can start:

* **When required by the rules:** When a rule or ability calls for a challenge. The rule will say what happens if the challenge succeeds or fails. 
* **When asked by the Host:** The Host can decide to ask a player to roll an Unopposed Challenge when they describe their character doing something dangerous or risky. If the player fails, the Host describes what happens instead.
* **When a character interferes with another:** When a player describes their character interfering with someone else's action, they roll an Opposed Challenge. The player that succeeds describes the outcome of the action.
* **When a character gathers information:** When a player asks questions about a scene, the Hosts can ask for an Unopposed Check to see if their character notices certain details, or comes to the correct conclusions.

When the game rules do not explicitly give a skill, approach, difficulty or complexity for an action, the Host decides how to set those. Two characters in an Opposed Challenge may use a different skill and approach or face a different complexity.

The Host may decide than an action, or something else a player describes simply impossible (for example, because it makes no logical sense). This does not create a challenge, and the story instead continues as would logically follow.

#### Unopposed Challenges

An **Unopposed Challenge** occurs vs a fixed **difficulty** set by the Host. The player passes the challenge if their result is higher or equal to the difficulty.

An easy challenge has a difficulty of 6, a moderate challenge has a difficulty of 8, a tough challenge has a difficulty of 10, and an unreasonable challenge has a difficulty of 12.

#### Opposed Challenges

An **Opposed Challenge** occurs between two characters. The character who has a higher result passes the challenge and the other fails.

If two characters tie, the character with the higher total approach and skill wins (or a randomly chosen character if they are still equal).

### Boost Dice and Boost Actions {.u}

During a challenge, characters can use **Boost Actions** to modify their challenge after they see the result (and tiebreakers are rolled).

Most Boost Actions add a **Boost Dice**, consuming an open slot ([△]{.symc}) to roll an additional four-sided dice and add it to the result. You can't use such Boost Actions if there are no remaining slots.

By default, all characters can spend 1 Light (if they have any) as a Boost Action to add a Boost Dice.

## Approaches

The three **approaches** represent different ways of approaching problems, and the fundamentally different ways those same skills can be used to cast magic.

Each approach is a single number that is added to the result of Challenges. If a character has 3 in an approach, they use it with great skill. With a 2, they use it with above average skill. With 1, they are below average. With 0, they are notably incapable. Values 4 and above represent outright superhuman skill.

Normally, a character can use the approach they are most comfortable with on a Challenge (and thus their highest value). However, you should expect that your character be put in situations where they cannot do so frequently.

### Dream {.u}

**Dream** is the approach used when someone approaches a problem through creativity or intuition.

With mundane skills, it represents solving problems indirectly, bypassing problems rather than approaching them, acting delicately or daintily, using unusual skills to create art, and awareness of esoteric or supernatural concepts.

Beyond mundane uses, Dream creates the magic of **Fantasia** — the magic that formed the materials and places of the Sea of Stars, manifests whatever the user imagines physically into reality.

When used with a Domain over Ice, it creates wings or a shield formed out of interwoven icicles. When used with a Domain over Light, it forms barriers of light or creates illusions.

### Heart {.u}

**Heart** is the approach used when someone approaches a problem through willpower or presence.

With mundane skills, it represents direct and forceful solutions, acting elegant and graceful, heartfelt emotional pleas, impulsive and emotional action, and awareness of people's feelings.

Beyond mundane uses, Heart creates the magic of **Fury** — the magic that fuels the elements and forces of the Sea of Stars, turning the user's emotion into roiling yet transient forces.

When used with a Domain over Ice, it chills things to freeze them instantly, or fires barrages of icicles that quickly melt away. When used with a Domain over Light, it projects searing light or blinding flashes.

### Focus {.u}

**Focus** is the approach used when someone approaches a problem through wit or knowledge.

With mundane skills, it represents calculated and preplanned action, acting calm and collected, appealing to someone's reason and sense, and actions requiring deep focus or concentration.

Beyond mundane uses, Focus creates the magic of **Arcana** — the magic that wove the rules and physics that govern the Sea of Stars, overlaying rules drawn from the user's mind over reality.

When used with a Domain of Ice, it can manifest auras that destroy heat or cause ice to never melt. When used with a Domain over Light, it can diffract light into impossible patterns or focus moonlight into a burning laser.
