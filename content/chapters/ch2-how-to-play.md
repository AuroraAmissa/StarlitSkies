This chapter explains the most essential rules of **Starlit Skies** and how to play it.

## Roleplaying

TODO: How to roleplay & the basics of characters

## Character Statistics

All characters in **Starlit Skies** have several **statistics** that connects who they are in roleplay to the tabletop game part of the system. A character's statistics are kept track of on a **character sheet** that gives you all the information you need to use the character with the game's rules.

### Approaches

Characters all have three **approaches** that represent how good they are at approaching problems in a certain way, and how proficient they are at the magic that originates from those mindsets. The approaches are:

* **Dream** shows how well someone approaches problems through creativity, and imagination. It fuels the magic of **Fantasia**, drawing on dreams and imagination and manifesting them into reality.
* **Heart** shows how well someone approaches problems through willpower or presence. It fuels the magic of **Fury**, drawing on boiling emotion and manifesting it as raw magical force.
* **Focus** shows how well someone approaches problems through wit, and knowledge. It fuels the magic of **Arcana**, drawing on knowledge of the world's workings to control the flows of magic.

Approaches (alongside skills) are added to checks when you need to roll dice.

### Traits

The three **traits** reflect who a character is, each corresponding to a specific approach. The traits are:

* **Image** is a character's view of who they are, or who they would want to be — such as Excitable Dancer, Flirty Princess, or Proper Lady. Image corresponds to the **Dream** approach.
* **Theme** is a character's emotional heart, and the emotions that best define their arc — such as Grief, Discovery, or Hope. Theme corresponds to the **Heart** approach.
* **Tale** is a character's history, and the things they learned growing up — such as Music Student, Art Lover, or Lawyer. Tale corresponds to the **Focus** approach.

Traits can be used to help overcome difficult challenges or to fuel Dissonance.

### Skills

In addition to the approaches, eight **skills** help define what characters are good at in mundane life. The skills are:

* **Athletics** shows how well someone uses physical prowess and strength, such as when climbing cliffs or bashing a door open.
* **Finesse** shows how well someone can move quickly or accurately, such as when navigating a tight corridor or picking a lock.
* **Awareness** shows how well someone remains aware of her surroundings in complicated situations or when distracted.
* **Analysis** shows how well someone can determine the implications of known facts and connect them together.
* **Intuition** shows how well someone picks up on unseen patterns and work with incomplete information.
* **Expression** shows how well someone expresses their own feelings, such as when pleading with someone or writing a poem.
* **Empathy** shows how well someone connects to others, such as to understand how they feel or comfort them.
* **Deception** shows how well someone deceives others, such as when sneaking through a building or hiding how she feels.

Skills (alongside approaches) are added to checks when you need to roll dice, and are especially important when dealing with hard tasks.

### Domains

The worlds of the Sea of Stars all have their own rules of magic, shaping raw Light into countless different forms. **Domains** are the special powers characters can draw from the Sea of Stars.

Authorities work like normal skills, but they aren't chosen from a fixed list. Starlit have their own **Starlit Authorities** that they can use anywhere, while Stars have **World Domains** that anyone in the world can learn to use.

#### Earth's Domains

**Earth** has four World Domains that are somewhere between skills and domains. They require resources and infrastructure that aren't always available, but are common from Old Earth being the origin of the stories in the Sea of Stars. These are:  

* **Engineering** shows your character's knowledge of mundane physics and how to build machines and infrastructure using it.
* **Computers** shows your how good your character is at working with computers, whether using them or creating new programs.
* **Medicine** shows how well your character understands anatomy and how to heal people using mundane means.
* **Nature** shows how well your character understands nature, and how to cultivate or care for plants, animals and ecosystems.

### Bonds

**Bonds** represent the connections characters have made to other people and the Stars. There are three kinds of bonds:

* **Personal Bonds**, representing your character's relationships with other characters.
* **World Bonds**, representing your character's understanding and integration into a Star.
* **Occulted Bonds**, representing the connections your character lost in the Shattering.

Bonds have **traits** just as characters do, helping detail how exactly a character views the relationship.

### Resolve and Health

Resolve and Health are two seperate measures of how much harm a character can take before being defeated. Damage to **Resolve** measures magical barriers and advanced armor, while damage to **Health** measures physical harm.

A character is **defeated** when their Resolve runs out, and **dies** when their Health runs out.

### Light

**Light** is a measure of how much energy a character has available to fuel their magic.

### Paths and Abilities

Paths and Abilities represent a character's specialized training in using a particular form of magic.

As they grow more experienced, characters gain **Experience** that can be spent to buy **Abilities**. Most of these abilities are part of a **Path**. When a character first gains a Path, they gain an additional way to gain Light in conflicts, and a powerful **Keystone Ability**.

However, characters can only have abilities from up to two different paths. Particularly strong characters may gain more, up to a maximum of three.
