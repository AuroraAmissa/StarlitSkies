Starlit Skies
=============

*Starlit Skies* is a tabletop system about magical girls at the end of the world.

Rendering
---------

Starlit Skies is typeset using the [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) document processor. It uses the [XeLaTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) rendering engine. This repository should contain everything you need to render it, as long as you have the needed software.

On Windows, install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and then install [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/Download#toc3).

On Arch Linux, it requires the following packages: `lyx texlive texlive-latexextra`.

Note that it (optionally) uses the `gitinfo2` package to embed revision information into the output PDF. Use a `git config --local core.hooksPath RulebookShared/hooks` command if you want to enable this for your copy.
