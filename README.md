Starlit Skies
=============

*Starlit Skies* is a tabletop system about magical girls at the end of the world.

Repo Setup
----------

Run `scripts/init.sh` on Linux after cloning the repository.

Rendering
---------

Starlit Skies is typeset using the [LyX] document processor. It uses the [XeLaTeX] rendering engine. This repository
should contain everything you need to render it, as long as you have the needed software.

To render it, you will need to install [TeX Live] and then install [LyX].

Building a Release
------------------

Release packages can only be built on Linux using the [Nix] package manager. Install nix, and use the scripts in
`scripts/*`. As a quick reference:

* `build.sh` - Builds the distribution release you normally download.
* `clean.sh` - Removes all files generated by the build script.
* `init.sh` - Initializes the repository after the initial checkout.
