This document is an early test version for 
\series bold
Starlit Skies
\series default
, a roleplaying system about magical girls trying to make the best of the
 end of the world.
 The system is overall meant as a successor to the Magical Burst 3rd Draft
 lineage of systems - one that was effectively abandoned by its original
 author after they converted their system into a PBTA.
 As such, it follows up on Fact's efforts to finish that branch of the system
 in his Project Rebirth and Burst Rewrite systems.

Input and suggestions for the game are very much appreciated! Please come
 talk to us in the Discord server linked below!

Credits

\begin_layout Itemize
Lymia, the main designer and author of this system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suzune, for her amazing help in designing the out-of-combat mechanics and
 inspiring me through the homebrew work she did in her own campaigns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tiamat Cordia, for their work in helping review the new Combat Ability trees
 for balance and clarity and generally helping with proofreading and systems
 design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fact, for laying the underlying groundwork for much of the revised combat
 in this system in his own Burst Rewrite and Project Rebirth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Everyone else who contributed to Project Rebirth, Burst Rewrite and Magical
 Burst 3rd Draft.
 Those systems are the direct lineage of Starlit Skies, and it would not
 exist without the work put into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The authors of Blades in the Dark and Valor: the Heroic Roleplaying System.
 They were the major inspirations for the overall structure of Starlit Skies,
 and the non-combat mechanics added in it.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Welcome to 
\series bold
Starlit Skies
\series default
, a roleplaying game for two to four players.
 In this game, you play a Starlit, one of those shining heroes born of the
 end of the world - who fight against the forces of darkness and decay that
 still threaten the world.
 Those who always hold in their hearts the one thing that humanity will
 always have; hope.
 In other words: Magical Girls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a system, it is designed for higher-powered campaigns where even though
 combat may sometimes be necessary, it can often be avoided or otherwise
 skipped, where as much focus is paid to the mundane and solving problems
 with magic as fighting against villains and more esoteric forces of darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this rulebook presents a specific setting, the system itself is designed
 to be usable (with modifications) for most of the magical girl genre.
 The system should also still be usable for other genres with similar themes
 or worldbuilding - such as superheroes or the likes of 
\emph on
Genshin Impact
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Magic the Gathering
\emph default
 and similar.
 The rules found in the Variant Rules section may be helpful to make the
 system match your setting better.
 That section should not be taken as an exhaustive list of changes you could
 make to the system, and this system has been built to try and make it easier
 to add new variant rules for your specific setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this game has primarily been playtested in online text-based games,
 it should be easily playable in person or over voice as well.
 All that is needed is pen and paper, and a fair number of ordinary six-sided
 dice.
 Though this system does not require it to be played, a calculator could
 still speed up running the game.

Shattered Stars

\begin_layout Standard
Earth was once a far grander world, full of tens of billions of people ‚Äì
 all living ten billion different lives, dreaming of as many different things.
 It seemed we would make it through it all okay, despite all the troubles
 of the era.
 That, in the far future, we could make the Utopia we all dreamed of.
